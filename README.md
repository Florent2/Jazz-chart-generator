# Academic Exercise: Markov Chains

_written by: Shane Emmons_

For this exercise you'll propose and implement a novel use of a Markov
Chains. Markov Chains are sequences of items where any item in the
sequence is dependent only on the item which comes before it. If you're
not familiar with Markov Chains, please take some time to research them
yourself. As usual,
[the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) is a
good start.

You don't have to limit your ideas to creating new sequences via some
input. You can also use it for prediction or ranking of items in the
sequence.

## Exercise Summary

- Propose a novel use for a Markov Chain.
  - No two students should work on the same application of a Markov
    Chain.
  - You cannot write a simple text generator.
  - If you need help coming up with something, ask us.
- Implement your idea.

## Submission Guidelines

If you plan to work on this exercise, you should fork this repository 
and push code early and often during the course. The course 
guidelines PDF explains the submission process in detail, but please 
contact an instructor if you have any questions.
