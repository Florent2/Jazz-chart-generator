# Jazz chart generator

From an existing jazz chart this command line utility semi-randomly generates 
a new "similar" jazz chart. 

For that it builds a representation of the initial chart in form of a 
[Markov Chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) where the chords are 
the states of the chain.

The generated chart is similar to the initial chart in the sense that
the chord transitions are generated by randomly picking among the existing 
chord transitions of the initial chart, the more a chord transition occurs in
the initial chart, the more chances it has to be picked when generating the 
new jazz chart.

This code is written during the 
[Mendicant University](http://mendicantuniversity.org/) 
course of January 2012.

## Usage

`./generate_chart.rb chart_file first_chord`

The chart file must be a text file where the chord names are simply separated 
by one or more spaces. See in the `charts` directory a few examples.

The first chord you choose to start your new chart must be a chord contained 
in the initial chart.

Example: `./generate_chart.rb charts/what-a-wonderful-world.chart A-`
